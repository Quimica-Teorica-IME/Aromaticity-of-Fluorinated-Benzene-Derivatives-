# Aromaticity-of-Fluorinated-Benzene-Derivatives-
Assessing the Aromaticity of Fluorinated Benzene Derivatives using new descriptors based on the distributed multipole analysis (DMA) partition of the electron density
In this repository, you will find the geometries of the ground states for neutral, cationic, and anionic forms of various systems.
Single-point calculations were performed using the PBE0 functional and the 6-31G++G(d,p) basis set with the Gaussian16 software. The data generated from these calculations are also included in this repository.
Additionally, the repository contains an Excel file with data obtained through the GDMA2 software for the mentioned systems. All analysis results, as well as the formatted checkpoint files, are available for review.
We hope this work is helpful for your research. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to contact us.
